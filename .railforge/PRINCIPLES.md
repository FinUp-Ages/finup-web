# Railforge Principles

## P1 - Requirements First

Understand the relevant goal, criteria, constraints, and non-goals before implementing.

## P2 - Recorded State

Development work should have a clear, recorded workflow state.

## P3 - Deliberate Transitions

Move between workflow stages intentionally and update the recorded state when the task changes stage or is completed.

## P4 - Scoped Work

Define the task scope and the files expected to change before implementation when appropriate to the size and risk of the work.

## P5 - Approved Scope Before Build

Implement only work that is understood, in scope, and aligned with the active task.

## P6 - No Silent Expansion

When new work is identified, make the scope change explicit and revisit requirements or planning as needed.

## P7 - Relevant Validation

Run the available and relevant checks before considering a change complete.

## P8 - Review Before Completion

Review the final diff and confirm the relevant criteria before marking the task as completed.

## P9 - User-Controlled Commits

Commits are separate from implementation and require explicit user authorization.

## P10 - Artifacts Over Memory

Versioned repository artifacts are the persistent source of truth. Conversation and agent memory are supporting context only.

## P11 - Proportional Process

Apply the workflow in proportion to the size, risk, and ambiguity of the change. Small, clear changes may use brief requirements, planning, and review records.

## P12 - Administrative Interface Context

For interface changes, preserve established React, Vite, TypeScript, and UI patterns. Consider the affected administrative flow, relevant feedback and access states, accessibility, and the supported desktop environment. Mobile support is not assumed.

## Limits

Railforge is a lightweight, documentation-based workflow. It does not provide a CLI, hooks, runtime enforcement, task-graph execution, or sandboxing.

It helps prevent accidental workflow drift, silent scope expansion, incomplete validation, and premature commits through clear records and review.
